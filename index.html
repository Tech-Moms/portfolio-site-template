      <p>It's optional, but you could write something brief about yourself and the job you want. For example: "A UI/UX
        designer with an eye for detail and a love of usability." Or "An aspiring web developer."</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="margin-sm">Spend a few sentences talking about your strengths. Think about what you want to highlight to
        a
        potential
        employer. Don't be shy--you are an asset!</p>
      <p class="margin-sm">This is one of the advantages of having a website in addition to a resume: you can go into
        greater detail to
        create a more dynamic picture of yourself.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="margin-lg">
      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p class="margin-sm">Here's where you can call out some specific abilities you have or technologies you
        understand. The things
        you've learned in Tech-Moms definitely count.</p>
      <p class="margin-sm">If you have completed projects or case studies, you could add change this section to be about
        those, or you
        could add another section about them. Include screenshots and links to the projects if you have them.</p>
      <h3>I have experience with</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>Another skill</li>
        <li>One more skill</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="margin-lg">
      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p class="margin-sm">If you have work experience relevant to the job that you want, list it here. You could use a
        combination of
        headings (h3), paragraphs, and unordered lists to do so, similar to what we did in the Skills section.</p>
      <p class="margin-sm">If you don't have relevant experience, make this section anything that highlights your
        qualifications:
        education, volunteer experience, certifications, training, awards, languages, endorsements from people who have
        collaborated with you, etc.</p>
