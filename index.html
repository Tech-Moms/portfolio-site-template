      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Spend a few sentences talking about your strengths. Think about what you want to highlight to a potential employer. Don't be shy--you are an asset!</p>
      <p>This is one of the advantages of having a website in addition to a resume: you can go into more detail to create a more dynamic picture of yourself.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="skills">
      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>Here's where you can call out some specific abilities you have or technologies you understand. The things you've learned in Tech-Moms definitely count.</p>
      <p>If you have completed projects or case studies, you could add change this section to be about those, or you could add another section about them. Include screenshots and links to the projects if possible, for example on Dribbble or Github.</p>
      <h3>I have experience with</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic HTML and CSS</li>
          <li>Another skill</li>
          <li>One more skill</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="experience">
      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <p>If you have work experience relevant to the job that you want, list it here. You could use a combination of headings (h3), paragraphs, and unordered lists to do so, similar to what we did in the Skills section.</p>
      <p>If you don't have relevant experience, make this section anything that highlights your qualifications: Education, Volunteer Experience, Certifications, Training, Awards, Languages, endorsements from people who have collaborated with you, etc.</p>
